ARC Raiders Gameplay Customization and Analysis Toolkit

This repository contains a set of custom modifications and analysis tools designed for research purposes and experimentation with ARC Raiders gameplay in controlled environments. This may include use on private servers, in training modes, or for creating educational content.

Important Warning: The use of third-party modifications in official online game sessions protected by anti-cheat systems (such as Easy Anti-Cheat) violates the End User License Agreement (EULA) and may lead to a permanent account ban. You assume all risks associated with using these materials.

Core Toolkit Features:

1. Enhanced Data Visualization System (Overlay): A utility that displays additional information in real-time over the game window: statistics, coordinates, object meta-data. All interface elements are configurable and can be disabled.
2. Configurable Automation Scripts (Macro Tools): A set of predefined and customizable scripts for automating repetitive actions. Intended to simplify testing and researching game mechanics.
3. User Interface Modifications (UI Mods): A set of optional alterations to the game's standard UI aimed at increasing informational clarity. Includes various filters for object display.
4. Data Collection and Logging Utility (Data Logger): A tool for passively collecting and recording in-game data (information about locations, objects, events). Useful for subsequent analysis and statistics generation.
5. Personal Preset System (Personal Presets): Allows for the creation, saving, and quick switching of complex configurations for all the above tools tailored to specific use cases.

Potential Use Cases:

· For researchers studying game mechanics and modding enthusiasts.
· For creators of educational and analytical game-related content.
· For testing in strictly isolated and controlled environments.

Operation and Installation:
The tools are implemented as a set of configuration files and scripts that interact with the game client through legitimate memory reading methods or, hypothetically, open APIs. Their management requires running a helper application (configuration manager).

Important: This project is strictly for research and educational purposes. We do not support, endorse, or bear responsibility for the use of these tools to gain an advantage in the game's online modes, which is a violation of its rules. The repository's goal is study and customization.
